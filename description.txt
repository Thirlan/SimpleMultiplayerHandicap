Version 1.14.0: Allows players on game start to select their skill level between Weak, Regular and Strong. Weak will give them a bonus to science, economy and military. Regular will give no bonuses and Strong will give a penalty. Those who choose Weak and Strong will be broadcast to the rest of the players. Also, an temporary bonus and penalty will be given every 5 years to the strongest and weakest players. If a player with a weak handicap does well then the handicap will also be removed. Same goes for a strong handicap, so players are not permanently handicapped if they start to win/lose.
