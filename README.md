## Introduction
Welcome! This mod is simple and focuses only on allowing players to give themselves a handicap at game start.

## Why was this mode created?
This mod was created to allow players of different skill levels to enjoy casual games of Stellaris with each other. 

### What does the mod do?
The mod provides players on game start with an event that allows them to decide what skill level they are at:

1. Weak
2. Regular
3. Strong

Choosing Weak will give the player a +8% boost to Energy, Minerals, Food, Unity, Research and Population growth.

Choosing Regular will give the player nothing.

Choosing Strong will give the player a -7% penalty to Energy, Minerals, Food, Unity, Research and Population growth.

The differences are such that the Strong and Weak players have a 15% difference between each other so that the Weak players have a fighting chance against stronger players. The difference is not meant to be so large between the Regular players and the others.

In addition to these, if a player picks Weak or Strong it will be broadcasted to the rest of the players.

Lastly, players will be given a second chance to confirm if they picked Weak or Strong after about 6 months. Just to make sure they didn't misclick.
