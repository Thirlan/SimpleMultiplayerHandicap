## Introduction
Welcome! This mod is simple and focuses on providing small handicaps to the strongest and weakest players in the game to allow for a diverse group of players to enjoy playing casually together.

### What does the mod do?
The mod provides players on game start with an event that allows them to decide what skill level they are at:

1. Weak
2. Regular
3. Strong

Choosing Weak will give the player a +10% boost to Energy, Minerals, Food, Unity, Research, Alloys, Consumer Goods, Population growth, Ship fire rate and more.

Choosing Regular will give the player nothing.

Choosing Strong will give the player the inverse of Weak with a -5% penalty.

The differences are such that the strong and weak players have a 15% gap between each other so that the weak players have a fighting chance against stronger players.

In addition to these, if a player picks weak or strong it will be broadcasted to the rest of the players so that everyone knows that someone picked their appropriate handicaps.

Lastly, players will be given a second chance to confirm if they picked Weak or Strong after about 3 months. Just to make sure they didn't misclick.

On top of these handicaps, every 5 years the game will give another -5% penalty, the Curse of Icarus, to specifical science, economy or military if a player is stronger than all the AI empires in a given category.

Inversely a 10% bonus, Blessings of the Underdog, to either science, economy or military will be given to the player that is weakest in a given category. This dynamic bonus/penalty will help further adjust the handicaps in case someone misjudged how strong or weak they are as well as help weak players stay in the game for the long run.

Note that if a player use to have the Weak bonus and they get the Curse of Icarus, then they will lose the Weak bonus.

Vice-versa, if a player use to have the Strong penalty and they get the Blessings of the Underdog then they will lose their Strong penalty.
